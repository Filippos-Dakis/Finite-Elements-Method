# Finite-Elements-Method
This set of scripts was a reasonable way to learn the rudiments of the
Finite Elements Method(FEM). I have taken some well known problems which 
have analytical solution and solved them computationally. I did this because 
I wanted to make sure that my results are consistent and also acquire confidence 
with my skills. Thus, in every script the analytical solution (or result)
is also provided so as the user can make their own tests. 

Regarding the FEM method, I have implemented first order scalar elements 
to solve problems like: 
1) Cylindrical capacitor.
2) Parallel plate capacitor
3) Circular and Rectangular metallic waveguides
4) 2D-Scattering problems.
Therefore, a better approach can be realized by increasing the nubmer of 
refinements in the geometry. 

A last but not least remark is that the scripts are written in a very 
user friendly way and I strongly recommend the user to go through the code 
and read it carefully. More specifically, I have written insightful comments 
at every single line and I have also inserted arrows like this :  " <----------------- "
which depicts the variables that I suggest the user to play with.
